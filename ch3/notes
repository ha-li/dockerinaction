docker allows you to get docker images in several ways

1. pull from a docker registry like Docker Hub or your own registry
      >docker pull busybox:latest
      >docker run -it --rm busybox:latest

      >docker pull quay.io/dockerinaction/ch3_hello_registry:latest
      >docker run -it --rm quay.io/dockerinaction/ch3_hello_registry:latest

2. you can also load/run the image from a file such as a tar file
      >docker load -i yourimage.tar

      eg to load/run busybox:latest from a tar, we can use the Docker Hub image by first
      converting it to a tar file and then loading it that way.
          1. pull the busybox:latest from Docker Hub
          2. convert image to tar file
          3. load/run the tar file

          >docker images  -- see what images are local
          >docker rmi busybox:latest  -- remove your busybox:latest images, then check to make sure it is gone (docker images)
          >docker pull busybox:latest   -- pull latest image
          >docker save -o busybox.tar busybox:latest -- save the pulled image as a tar
          >docker rmi busybox   -- remove it (since you pulled it)
          >docker load -i busybox.tar  --load the image
          >docker images   -- you should see it now
          >docker run -it --rm busybox:latest /bin/sh    (run the image)


3. using Dockerfile (docker build/installation) along with your bundle of files
     you can distribute a docker image via a Dockerfile and then build the image from the Dockerfile.
     typically you distribute a Dockerfile along with your git repo

     >git clone https://github.com/dockerinaction/ch3_dockerfile.git
     >cd ch3_dockerfile
     >docker build -t dia_ch3/dockerfile:latest .
     >docker images (see what the image is)
     >docker run -it --rm dia_ch3/dockerfile:latest
     >docker rmi dia_ch3/dockerfile   (delete the image)
