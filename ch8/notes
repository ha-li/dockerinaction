Dockerfile 
- is a set of instructions for building a docker image
- instructions are read and processed from top to bottom
- each instruction results in a new layer in the file image
- to reduce the number of layers, multiple instructions are concatentated together using &&
- building images via Dockerfiles simplifies tasks like adding/copying files to your image

Docker build command:
   > docker build --tag <image_name>:<tag> .

   where . specifies the location of Dockerfile, when completed, running
   > docker images

   should reveal your new image <image_name>

Comments inside the Dockerfile
  - any line beginning with # is a comment

Multiple copies of docker build files can be used. 

Instructions (14 total) 
FROM - tells docker to start with this image as the base image. This must be the first statement in any Dockerfile 
       if starting from an empty image, then your first statement should be:
          FROM scratch

MAINTAINER - sets the maintainer name and email for the image being built 
RUN - commands to run for creating the image, things like 
       apt-get update && apt-get install -y git
      by chaining together several commands you reduce the layers of the final image
ENTRYPOINT - sets teh entrypoint to the image
             there are 2 ways to set teh entry point, each has its nuances
                1. ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2", ...] (exec way, preferred)
                2. ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2 (shell form)

            - the exec way is preferred. 
                command line args to 'docker run <image>' will append all the arguments after <image> to the exec form, 
                 eg docker run image -d   
                will pass the -d to the entry point 

            - the shell form will prevent CMD or run arguments from being used, 
                 but the value of ENTRYPOINT will be started as a subcommand of /bin/sh -c, so no signals will be passed

ENV - sets environment variables for an image (similar to --env flag on docker run/create)
    - chain multiple environment variable settings together with && to keep the layer to 1, unless you want to set 2 layers
    - when chaining, keep lines clean and easy to read by using \ at the end of each 
    - environment variables declare like so are made available to the resulting image, but also 
      can be used in the docker file after they are set

LABEL - used to define key/value pairs that get saved as metadata for the image/container.
      - you can see the metadata in a 'docker inspect' command
      - chain multiple labels together using \ to keep it clean an minimize image layers
      - use LABEL along with ENV to declare an image environment variable, as well as save to its label
      - is similar to --label flag in docker run/create

WORKDIR - sets the default working directory of the image/container
        - sets teh working directory for any RUN|CMD|ENTRYPOINT|COPY|ADD instruction that follows in the dockerfile.
        - if the WORKDIR does not exist, will create it

EXPOSE - opens a TCP port

USER - sets the user and group for all further build sets and containers created from the image 
     - you only want to set the user in the top most level since setting it in a base/lower layer
       will prevent downstream dockerfiles from installing software, which means that those dockerfiles
       would need to flip user back and forth, creating additional layers. Instead, the right pattern
       would be to create users/groups in base layer as part of RUN command, and then only
       set the default user in the top most docker file

.dockerignore - tells docker to ignore these files so they do not end up in a docker image

One aspect of building images in layers is that if a previous layer was already built (prior build cycle)
it will get cached and the build will not rebuild that layer (results in faster builds).
